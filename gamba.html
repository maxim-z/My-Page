    I HAS A MAX_GEN ITZ 200             BTW whats the highest random number to generate

    BTW random number generator below!
    OBTW  Copyright (C) 2014 Wizardry and Steamworks - License: GNU GPLv3  TLDR
    I HAS A COUNTER ITZ MOD OF COUNTER_MODE AN MAX_GEN
    HOW IZ I RANDOMY YR NUMBER                      BTW function RANDOMY takes in a NUMBER
        I HAS A THING ITZ MAEK NUMBER A NUMBAR
        IM IN YR LOOP UPPIN YR ROUNDS WILE DIFFRINT ROUNDS AN NUMBER
            THING R MOD OF PRODUKT OF 75 AN SUM OF THING AN COUNTER AN 65537

        IM OUTTA YR LOOP
        FOUND YR MOD OF THING AN NUMBER
    IF U SAY SO

    BTW how to use this random number generator VISIBLE I IZ RANDOMY YR 100 MKAY

    OBTW so im trying to make a while loop here because lolcode doesnt
    actually have support for it. if user makes a guess like "HIGHER" or "LOWER"
    then the counter gets set to -1 so that it increments to 0 making it never
    increment to 1 but if user types "QUIT" then I_COUNTER increments to 1 and
    the loop is exited out of ending the guessing game
    TLDR

    I HAS A EZ_PZ ITZ 0                 BTW 0 means user didnt type EZ PZ to end game 1 means they did
    I HAS A RANDOM                      BTW used to store random number generated by RANDOMY
    I HAS A HALF_MAX_GEN ITZ 0          BTW this is half of the value of MAX_GEN
    I HAS A COINS ITZ 0                 BTW how much user lost
    I HAS A ADD_COINS ITZ 0             BTW how much coins to add to user
    I HAS A SUB_COINS ITZ 0             BTW how much coins to subtract from the user
    I HAS A GAMBA ITZ ""                BTW used to store input from user
    I HAS A I_COUNTER ITZ 0             BTW I_COUNTER used in for loop
